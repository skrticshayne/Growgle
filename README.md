# Growgle
Growgle Development Github - 


Growgle will be an application designed for users to be able to maintain and grow a succesfull Garden with limited botanist knowledge 


Growgle will do this by... 

implenting a machine learning model to help users answer questions specific to their gardens 

Auto populating a Calender for users to properly maintain garden

Give users soecific guidance on their tasks 

allow user input to put in adverse conditions 

allow user data (location) to be put into the system to predictavly give input on status of plants ie (watered not watered...)


Begin by developing the backend components of Growgle. This involves setting up a server to handle requests from the frontend, 
implementing APIs for data exchange, and integrating necessary libraries and frameworks. Use a language and framework suitable 
for backend development, such as Python with Flask or Django.
  - So for this start with a simple server to have users
      - data for users should be able to be added to so that we can keep track of specific users and their gardens (prolly use someone elses user database for this from github
      - make sure its not under license tho  )
  -API- Weather Api
      - user gives adress return a csv file (or something else) with neccesary data humidity/ rain/ temp/ air quality?/ idk anything that could pertain
   
Lets start with these two then plan where to go from there.
